# Flickr Foundation Dataset Cards

This repo contains a WORK IN PROGRESS dataset card template for the [Flickr Foundation](https://www.flickr.org). The repo was forked from [Smithsonian](https://github.com/Smithsonian/dataset-cards). 

We are considering what a dataset card might look like for Flickr Commons and Commons members' datasets as they become unmoored from flickr.com. Keep an eye on the [Content Mobility program](https://www.flickr.org/programs/content-mobility/) to see what we're up to. 

This repo was created during my Research Fellowship at Flickr Foundation.
